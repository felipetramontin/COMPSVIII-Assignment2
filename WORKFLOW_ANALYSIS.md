# WORKFLOW_ANALYSIS.md

## a. What triggers this workflow to run?
This workflow is triggered when code is **pushed** to the main branch or when a **pull request** targets the main branch.

## b. What are the four main steps this workflow performs?
- **Checkout code** – retrieves the repository code so the workflow can access all files.  
- **Validate HTML** – checks all HTML files to ensure they are correctly structured.  
- **Check links** – verifies that links in Markdown and HTML files are not broken.  
- **Deploy to GitHub Pages** – uploads the website and publishes it only if all previous steps succeed.

## c. What does the "Checkout code" step do and why is it necessary?
- **Function:** Downloads the repository content to the GitHub Actions runner.  
- **Reason it is necessary:** Without this step, the workflow cannot access your HTML, Markdown, or other project files to test, validate, or deploy them.

## d. What is the purpose of the environment configuration?
The environment configuration sets up the GitHub Pages deployment environment. Its purpose is:  
- To provide a stable environment for deployment.  
- To automatically track deployment history.  
- To generate the URL for the deployed site.

## e. How does this automated deployment improve reliability compared to manual deployment?
- It ensures the website is deployed **only if HTML validation and link checks pass**.  
- It reduces human errors that can occur during manual deployments.  
- It tracks deployment history and automatically updates the GitHub Actions status badge.

## f. What would happen if you pushed code to a different branch (not main)?
- The workflow **would not run** because it is configured to trigger only on pushes or pull requests to the main branch.  
- No deployment, HTML validation, or link checks would occur on other branches.
